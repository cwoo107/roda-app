                            The Member Portal is a web application I developed that allows USA North's 
                            over 1,600 utility members to manage their account profiles themselves, 
                            guaranteeing excavators have the most up to date information. Prior to this, 
                            the information was collected through a series of online forms that submitted the information via 
                            email and was then manually entered into the system by an operator. Before launching, 
                            it had taken the staff the first 8 months of the year to update less than 5% of their data according to their metrics. 
                            Within two weeks of going live with the application, it had already surpased their year to date total. 
                            It is mostly built with Ruby on Rails with Postgresql, with support of some Golang APIs, and is 
                            using Devise for authentication. It is currently running on Heroku</p>
